Papaye Fast Foods Limited was incorporated as a Limited Liability Company on the 20th of November, 1990 and was issued with certificate to commence business on the 17th of June, 1991.

  
Papaye started with a work force of 12 in 1991 but the number increased to 652 as of now. Thus offering job opportunities to both Ghanaians and foreigners.

  
The Company has the distinction of being the pioneer of the Fast Food restaurants in Accra. Over the years Papaye has kept faith with a strategy which was to prepare fast foods using recipes designed by the company thereby giving their food a unique flavour. This is indicated by the manner in which Papaye has become a household name in Ghana.
